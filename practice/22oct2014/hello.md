# Hello there!

This is a warm-up exercise.

The program should read a series of lines of input from the standard input (i.e., **System.in** under Java, **stdin** under C, **cin** under C++.)  Each line will contain a name.  For each input line, the program should print an output line of the form

<pre>
Hello, <i>name</i>
</pre>

where *name* is the text read from the input line.

## Example input

The input to the program could be something like:

    Angua
    Carrot
    Nobby

## Example output

For the input should above, the output should be

    Hello, Angua
    Hello, Carrot
    Hello, Nobby
